Deletes hound comments off PRs. Mac OS only, for now

# Usage
```
dehound <pull-request-url>...
```

Multiple pull requests are supported. Separate with a space. You _may_ want to surround your URLs with `""`

## Authentication
Uses keychain to store access credentials for github. On first run, it should prompt you for an application-specific key.

# Compiling

```
nim build
```

If you have [upx](https://upx.github.io/) installed and available in your PATH, the build script will find and use it to minify the executable.

# FAQs

+ **Can I restore a deleted comment?** Nope, you cannot. Blame github, not me
+ **Why?** Because nothing is better than 50 comments for _every_ push telling you the same thing you already don't care about
+ **Shouldn't you fix your hound first** What makes you think its my hound?
